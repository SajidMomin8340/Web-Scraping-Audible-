# Web-Scraping-Audible-
Audible is the leading producer and provider of audio storytelling
It has facilitated audiobooks and podcasts to listeners in over 180 countries, in 47 languages.
I have scraped their website including all their audiobooks (title, author, and length of audiobook]. The technology that was used was the Python library selenium. It automates the task and gives crystal-clear data. This project helped me to learn selenium in-depth and understand challenges and how to overcome them.#webscraping
